# Reconstructing CSE

This repo contains the SML programs included in the paper
"Reconstructing a Notional Machine for Modern Scripting Languages".

## Features

The programs in the `src` folder all run in Moscow ML. They are
extended versions of the programs in the paper, typically by
adding support for integers so that more interesting example
programs can run.

## Usage

Just clone the repo and run the programs separately in Moscow ML, for example:

```bash
# mosml cse.ml
```
The programs contain some test cases at the end.

## License

## Todo

More test cases; automated testing.
